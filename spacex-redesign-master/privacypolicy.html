If you use an authorized agent to submit a request under the CCPA, please have the authorized agent take the following steps in addition to the steps described in Section 1 above: (1) Mail a notarized copy of your written declaration authorizing the agent to act on your behalf to the address listed below (we will reimburse you for the costs of notarizing the declaration and mailing it to us if you provide a receipt showing the costs paid and they are reasonable); and (2) Provide any information we request from you to verify your identity and that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit a request under the CCPA on your behalf.</p>

<h3><strong>3.  How Do We Protect Personal Data if we transfer it internationally?</strong></h3>
<p><strong></strong>We may transfer your personal data to service providers and business partners outside of the EEA and/or UK.</p>
<p>Some of these recipients are located in countries in respect of which either the European Commission and/or UK Government (as and where applicable) has issued adequacy decisions, in which case, the recipient’s country is recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection under UK and/or European data protection laws (as applicable) and the transfer is therefore permitted under Article 45 of the GDPR.</p>
<p>Some recipients of your personal data may be located in countries outside the EEA and/or the UK for which the European Commission or UK Government (as and where applicable) has not issued adequacy decisions in respect of the level of data protection in such countries (“<strong>Restricted Countries</strong>”). For example, the United States is a Restricted Country. Where we transfer your personal data to a recipient in a Restricted Country, we will either:</p>
<ul>
<li>enter into appropriate data transfer agreements based on so-called Standard Contractual Clauses approved from time-to-time under GDPR Art. 46 by the European Commission, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office or UK Government (as and where applicable); or</li>
<li>rely on other appropriate means permitted by GDPR Ch. V, which establish that such recipients will provide an adequate level of data protection and that appropriate technical and organizational security measures are in place to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and against all other unlawful forms of processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may ask for a copy of such appropriate data transfer agreements by contacting us using the contact details below.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>4.  How Long Do We Keep Personal Data?</strong></h3>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>5.  Your Rights</strong></h3>

<li>
<strong>Request the transfer of your personal data </strong>to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine- readable format.
